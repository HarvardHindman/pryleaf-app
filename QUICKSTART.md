## Step 1: Apply Database Migrations

1. Open your Supabase Dashboard: https://app.supabase.com/project/mjxtzwekczanotbgxjuz

2. Go to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)

3. Copy and paste each migration file, run them in order:

### Migration 1: Create Tables
```sql
-- Copy contents from: supabase/migrations/20250113000001_create_community_tables.sql
-- Then click RUN
```

### Migration 2: Security Policies
```sql
-- Copy contents from: supabase/migrations/20250113000002_create_rls_policies.sql
-- Then click RUN
```

### Migration 3: Sample Data (Optional)
```sql
-- Copy contents from: supabase/migrations/20250113000003_seed_initial_data.sql
-- Then click RUN
```

✅ **Verify**: Run this to check tables were created:
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name LIKE 'communit%';
```

You should see 9 tables.

---

## Step 2: Start Your Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## Step 3: Browse Communities

Open: http://localhost:3000/community

You should see:
- ✅ Beautiful community browse page
- ✅ Search and filter functionality

- ✅ Grid/List view toggle

---

## Step 4: View a Community

- ✅ Community profile
- ✅ Membership tiers
- ✅ Pricing comparison
- ✅ Join buttons

---

## Step 5: Join a Free Tier (Test)

2. Click "Join Free" on any community
3. You should become a member!

---

## 🎨 Test Light/Dark Mode

1. Click the theme toggle in the top right
2. Watch everything adapt automatically!

## 🧪 Test API Endpoints

### Get All Communities
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/communities
```

### Get Community Details
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/communities/COMMUNITY_ID
```

### Create a Community (Authenticated)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/communities \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Trading Community",
    "handle": "mytrading",
    "description": "Learn to trade like a pro",
    "specialty": "Day Trading",
    "category": "Day Trading"
  }'
```

---

## 📱 Test Responsive Design

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Click device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M)
3. Test different screen sizes:
   - iPhone SE (375px)
   - iPad (768px)
   - Desktop (1920px)

Everything should look perfect at all sizes!

---

## 🎯 What to Try Next

### Create Your First Community

**Via SQL Editor:**
```sql
INSERT INTO communities (
  owner_id,
  name,
  handle,
  description,
  specialty,
  category,
  status
) VALUES (
  'YOUR_USER_ID',
  'My Awesome Community',
  'myawesome',
  'The best trading community ever',
  'Options Trading',
  'Options Trading',
  'active'
);
```

Replace `YOUR_USER_ID` with your actual user ID from `auth.users`.

### Add Custom Tiers

```sql
INSERT INTO community_tiers (
  community_id,
  name,
  description,
  price_monthly,
  tier_level,
  features,
  perks,
  sort_order
) VALUES (
  'YOUR_COMMUNITY_ID',
  'Premium',
  'Get access to premium content',
  4900,  -- $49.00
  1,
  '[{"name": "Premium Videos", "enabled": true}]'::jsonb,
  ARRAY['All premium content', 'Live sessions'],
  1
);
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Communities Not Showing Up
- Check database migrations were applied
- Verify communities have `status = 'active'`
- Check browser console for errors

### Can't Join Community
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check tier is `is_active = true`
- Verify membership doesn't already exist

### Styling Looks Wrong
- Clear browser cache
- Check `community.css` is imported in `globals.css`
- Verify CSS custom properties are defined

### API Errors
- Check `.env.local` has correct Supabase URL and keys
- Restart dev server after env changes
- Check Supabase dashboard for RLS policy errors

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Enable Seed Data
The seed data creates 2 sample communities with:
- Sarah's Options Trading Academy
- Marcus's Technical Analysis Hub

Perfect for testing!

### Inspect Database
Use Supabase Table Editor to:
- View all communities
- Check membership records
- Modify tiers
- See real-time changes

### Use Browser DevTools
- **Network tab**: See API calls
- **Console**: Check for errors
- **React DevTools**: Inspect component state

---

## 🎨 Customization Ideas

### Change Tier Colors
Edit `src/styles/community.css`:
```css
.tier-badge-premium {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, YOUR_COLOR_1, YOUR_COLOR_2);
}
```

### Add New Categories
Update `categories` array in `src/app/community/page.tsx`:
```typescript
const categories = [
  'All',
  'Options Trading',
  'Your New Category', // Add here
  ...
];
```

### Modify Tier Features
Edit in database or via API:
```sql
UPDATE community_tiers 
SET features = '[
  {"name": "New Feature", "enabled": true}
]'::jsonb
WHERE id = 'tier-id';
```
