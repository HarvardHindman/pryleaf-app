# ðŸŽ‰ Stream Chat + Community Integration - Complete!

## What We've Built

### âœ… **Stream Chat Fully Integrated with Communities**

Your chat system is now **community-specific** - users only see chat channels for communities they've joined!

---

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### 1. **Stream Chat Service** (`src/lib/streamChatService.ts`)
Complete service layer for managing community channels:

âœ… **Functions:**
- `createCommunityChannel()` - Create new channels for communities
- `grantCommunityChannelAccess()` - Grant user access based on tier level
- `revokeCommunityChannelAccess()` - Remove access when leaving
- `updateCommunityChannelAccess()` - Update when tier changes
- `getUserCommunityChannels()` - Get all channels user can access
- `createDefaultCommunityChannels()` - Auto-create #announcements & #general

âœ… **Features:**
- Tier-based access control
- Automatic permission sync
- Channel grouping by community
- Moderator roles for creators

---

### 2. **Updated Community Service** (`src/lib/communityService.ts`)

âœ… **Enhanced `createCommunity()`:**
- Creates community in database
- Creates default free tier
- **NEW:** Creates Stream Chat channels automatically
- **NEW:** Stores channel references in `community_channels` table

âœ… **When Community Created:**
```
1. Community record â†’ Supabase
2. Free tier â†’ Supabase
3. #announcements â†’ Stream Chat (tier 0)
4. #general â†’ Stream Chat (tier 0)
5. Channel records â†’ Supabase
6. Creator = moderator + member
```

---

### 3. **Updated Join Community** (`src/app/api/communities/[id]/join/route.ts`)

âœ… **When User Joins:**
```javascript
1. Create membership in database
2. Calculate user's tier level
3. Grant access to ALL channels at or below tier level
4. User added as member in Stream Chat
```

âœ… **When User Leaves:**
```javascript
1. Update membership status
2. Remove from ALL community channels
3. Clean up access
```

---

### 4. **Dynamic Sidebar Navigation** (`src/components/CommunityNavigation.tsx`)

âœ… **Smart Community Sidebar:**
- Fetches user's communities via `/api/user/channels`
- Groups channels by community
- Shows tier badges (F/P/E)

---

### 5. **New API Endpoint** (`src/app/api/user/channels/route.ts`)

```

  "communities": [
    {
      "community": { "id": "...", "name": "...", "handle": "..." },
      "tier": { "name": "Premium", "tier_level": 1 },

          "minimumTierLevel": 0
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 6. **Updated AppLayout** (`src/components/AppLayout.tsx`)

âœ… **Changes:**
- **Removed:** General "/chat" navigation
- **Added:** "My Communities" section in sidebar

  â†’ Creates record in community_memberships

// 2. Grant channel access
  â†’ Calls grantCommunityChannelAccess()
  â†’ Adds user to Stream Chat channels

// 3. Sidebar updates
  â†’ CommunityNavigation fetches /api/user/channels
  â†’ Displays new channels
  â†’ User clicks â†’ Chat opens!
```

### Channel Naming Convention:

```
Format: community_{communityId}_{channelName}

Examples:
- community_abc123_announcements
