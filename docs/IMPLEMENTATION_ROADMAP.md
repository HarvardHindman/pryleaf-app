# Community Platform - Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

We're building a **hybrid financial platform** that combines:
- ✅ **Free Research Tools**: Stock analysis, portfolio tracking, market data (existing)
- 🆕 **Paid Community Platform**: Patreon/Whop-style creator communities with tiered subscriptions

### Key Decision: Chat Technology
**Recommendation: Keep Stream Chat** ✅

**Reasoning:**
- Already integrated (don't waste the work)
- $989/mo at 1,000 users vs $20k-40k to build custom solution
- Enterprise features (moderation, presence, notifications)
- At scale (1,000 paying users): infrastructure is only 3% of revenue
- Focus dev time on unique value: community tiers, content gating, creator tools

### Tech Stack
```
Frontend:    Next.js 14 (App Router) ✅
Database:    Supabase (Postgres) ✅
Auth:        Supabase Auth ✅
Chat:        Stream Chat ✅
Storage:     Supabase Storage 🆕
Payments:    Stripe 🆕
Email:       Resend 🆕
```

## Architecture Overview

### Data Flow

```
User Journey:
1. Browse communities (public, no auth required)
2. View community profile (tiers, preview content)
3. Select tier & subscribe
   ├── Free: Instant access
   └── Paid: Stripe Checkout → Webhook → Grant access
4. Access community
   ├── View tier-gated content
   ├── Join tier-specific channels
   └── Interact with creator & members
```

### Database Schema (Simplified)

```
communities
├── id, owner_id, name, handle, description
├── avatar_url, banner_url, specialty
└── subscriber_count, verified

community_tiers
├── id, community_id, name, description
├── price_monthly, price_yearly
├── tier_level (0=free, 1=premium, 2=elite)
└── stripe_price_id

community_memberships
├── id, community_id, user_id, tier_id
├── status (active/cancelled/expired)
├── current_period_start, current_period_end
└── stripe_subscription_id

community_channels
├── id, community_id, stream_channel_id
├── name, minimum_tier_level
└── channel_type

community_content
├── id, community_id, creator_id

## Cost Projections

### Monthly Costs @ 1,000 Users (500 paying @ $49 avg)

```
Revenue:           $24,500/mo
├─ Stripe fees:    -$860/mo (3.5%)
├─ Stream Chat:    -$989/mo (4%)
